            Bhagat Singh was born on September 27, 1907 in the hamlet of Banga in
            the Lyallpur district of Punjab, in what was then British India and is
            now Pakistan; he was the second of Vidyavati and her husband Kishan
            Singh Sandhu's seven children—four sons and three girls. Bhagat Singh's
            father and uncle, Ajit Singh, were involved in progressive politics,
            participating in the Canal Colonization Bill movement in 1907 and the
            Ghadar Movement in 1914–1915.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore
            after being sent to a rural school in Banga for a few years. In 1923, he
            enrolled in the National College in Lahore, which had been established
            two years before by Lala Lajpat Rai in reaction to Mahatma Gandhi's
            non-cooperation movement, which pushed Indian students to avoid schools
            and colleges sponsored by the British Indian government.
        </p>
        <p>
            Singh was detained in May 1927 on the premise of being engaged in a
            bombing that occurred in Lahore in October 1926, when police got worried
            about his impact on youngsters. Five weeks after his arrest, he was
            freed on a Rs. 60,000 surety. He contributed to low-cost booklets
            produced by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha that excoriated the British and
            wrote for and edited Urdu and Punjabi newspapers published in Amritsar.
            He also contributed to Kirti, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party
            ("Workers and Peasants Party"), as well as the Delhi-based Veer Arjun
            newspaper. He utilised a variety of aliases, including Balwant, Ranjit,
            and Vidhrohi.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bhagat Singh became disillusioned with Gandhi’s philosophy of
            non-violence after Gandhi called off the non-cooperation movement.He
            also joined the Hindustan Republican Association, which had prominent
            leaders, such as Chandrashekhar Azad, Ram Prasad Bismil and Shahid
            Ashfaqallah Khan.</p>
        <p>His Parents propelled him for an arrange marriage and
            to avoid it Singh ran away to kanpur (Cawnpore) in which he wrote:</p>
        <i> My
            life has been dedicated to the noblest cause, that of the freedom of the
            country. Therefore, there is no rest or worldly desire that can lure me
            now.</i>

            <ul>
                <li>In 1919, when Jalianwala Bagh massacre took place,
                    Bhagat Singh was only 12 years old.
                    He was deeply disturbed by the incident. On next day,
                    went to Jalianwala Bagh and collected soil from the
                    spot and kept it as a memento for the rest of his life.
                </li>
                <li>In 1928, the Simon Commission was headed by Sir John Simon to address the
                    political issues in India. Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against
                    the Commission as it did not include a single Indian as its members.
                    The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi
                    charge on the protesters which consequently led to death of Lala Lajpat Rai.
                    He died on 17 November 1928.
                </li>
                <li>Deeply affected by the death of Rai, Singh made a conspiracy with revolutionaries like Shivaram
                    Rajguru,
                    Sukhdev Thapar and Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott but the plant couldn’t be excuted
                    properly and they killed John P. Saunders, an Assistant Superintendent of Police.

                    as well as availability of books and a daily newspaper. They finally land up to Hunger’s Strike.
